# DotaFix
Dota 2 hero counter picker and assistant based on dotabuff and stratz data
## Description
This is my attempt to build the best Dota 2 draft counter picker out there.  I've also built pages that give interesting information like item builds, detailed hero comparisons, counters & combos and more.  Nothing is hard coded in the app, even things like deciding who is a support and who is a carry is done through match data.
